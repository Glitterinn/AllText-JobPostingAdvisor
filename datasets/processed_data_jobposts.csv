"USAID, DCHA and LWVF
TITLE:   Annual Program Statement: Implementation and Extension of
Wheelchair Services
APS No. M/OP/DCHA/DOFDA-03-1344
DESCRIPTION:   The United States Government (USG), as represented by the
United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Bureau for
Democracy Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA), Leahy War Victims
Fund (LWVF) is seeking applications from US and non-US non-profit or
for-profit, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), international
organizations (IOs), and other qualified non-USG organizations (or
consortia) for the implementation and extension of wheelchair services
for civilian victims of war and other people with disabilities. This
program is authorized in accordance with the Foreign Assistance Act of
1961, as amended. Awards shall be made in accordance with 22 CFR 266,
OMB Circulars A-21 (for universities) or A-122 (for non-profit
organizations), ADS 303 and USAID Standard Provisions. 
For more than a decade, the WVF has maintained a primary objective of
expanding access to affordable and appropriate prosthetic and orthotic
services. Although much work remains to improve the quality, expand the
availability, and reduce the costs of prosthetic services, the Fund is
increasing its involvement in response to other challenges. The
overwhelming needs of persons requiring wheelchairs is one of those
challenges. 
Applicants under this APS should propose innovative ideas that address
the physical, social, and/or economic needs of persons requiring
wheelchairs. Prospective partners could include a wide range of U.S.,
international, and regional organizations such as: private voluntary
organizations, foundations, colleges and universities, civic groups,
faith-based institutions, private businesses and associations,
philanthropic organizations, and advocacy groups. The Bureau strongly
encourages U.S. organizations to collaborate with indigenous
organizations in their proposals. 
Organizations should already be registered with USAID. If not already
registered, U.S. PVOs can register athttp://www.usaid.gov/hum_response/pvc/regtoc.html, though the process
can be time consuming. Eligible Public International Organizations
(PIOs) can be found at http://www.usaid.gov/pubs/ads/300/30851m.pdf.
Host country-based NGOs should seek to register at the nearest USAID
Mission. 
USAID encourages qualified applicants to submit thoughtful and
innovative approaches that have high potential for successful
achievement of project objectives. Upon award, grants or cooperative
agreements will be managed/ monitored by either the DCHA Bureau in
Washington or field Missions, depending on the scope or nature of the
proposed activities. 
1. Introduction:  Conservative estimates put the number of people with
disabilities in developing countries at close to half a billion. Of
these, an estimated twenty million require wheelchairs to be mobile. 
While there are many humanitarian and development agencies involved in
prosthetics/orthotic programs, there are only a few who provide a
comprehensive approach to services for those requiring wheelchairs and
the associated training and education that must accompany their
provision. 
The statistics are startling: 
- UNESCO estimates that 20 million people in the world need a wheelchair
that don't have one; 
- The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that by the year 2020
road traffic accidents will account for the third highest cause of the
global burden of disease. This is a significant jump from its current
ranking of ninth. Developing countries will be largely responsible for
this sharp rise and many survivors may sustain mobility-related
injuries; 
- WHO data further suggest that between 20-40 people per million will
sustain a spinal cord injury in any one year, many of whom will be
confined to a wheelchair; 
- The incidence of cerebral palsy in the United States is about 1 in
93,000. In the developing world, the incidence is near 1 in 400 and many
with CP require wheelchairs for mobility; 
- Consensus estimates indicate that 26,000 people are killed or maimed
by land mines each year. Many of the injured will be wheelchair bound. 
Despite this overwhelming need, only a small percentage of people in the
developing world are able to obtain an appropriate wheelchair, the
requisite training needed to assist them to obtain their maximum
independence and functionality, and the opportunities to be contributing
members of their families, communities, and society. 
A wheelchair is more than just an aid to mobility. It can be a means to
self-sufficiency and increased self-esteem. It can be a vehicle to
meaningful employment and contributions to community and society. It
reduces dependency and the associated burden placed on family and
friends. 
Since 1989, the LWVF has invested significant resources in the
development and implementation of rehabilitation programs worldwide.
Several of these programs have included relatively minor wheelchair
provision and services activities. This APS represents a mechanism to
expand the scope of the activities specifically addressing the
comprehensive needs of persons requiring wheelchairs. 
2. Background:  Established in 1989, the Leahy War Victims Fund (LWVF),
administered by USAID, provides assistance to war victims in developing
countries. The Fund provides a dedicated source of financial and
technical assistance for civilian victims of war who suffer from
mobility-related injuries, including people who suffer from polio as a
result from interrupted immunization services. 
In the past decade, the Fund has devoted the major part of its resources
to the establishment and improvement of accessible and appropriate
prosthetic services. This decision was based upon the realization that
with its modest resources, the Fund would have the greatest impact on
the greatest number of people through the provision of ""unassisted
mobility."" The Fund also devotes substantial attention to ensure that
service providers incorporate appropriate follow up and monitoring of
beneficiaries of services. 
More recently the Fund has extended its scope selectively in response to
the needs of different populations of war victims. For instance, in some
countries there is a great need for rapid treatment of victims who
suffer general medical trauma from accidental detonation of unexploded
ordinance and less of a need for treatment of mine amputee victims.
Other LWVF responses include assistance to improve surgical preparation
for prosthetic fitting, strengthening organizations that address the
needs of PWDs, improved physical and occupational rehabilitation
services, and support for innovative approaches to increase
income-generating opportunities for war victims. 
The Leahy War Victims Fund has now provided over $ 90 million in more
than 22 countries in support of civilian victims of war. Detailed
descriptions of current country initiatives can be found athttp://www.leahywarvictimsfund.org/ Descriptions found at this web site
outline the scope of activities currently being funded through the Leahy
War Victims Fund. 
3. Program Components:  This Annual Program Statement may support
multiple activities that will be responsive to critical needs. However,
Leahy War Victims Fund philosophy must be foundational to the proposal: 
The LWVF believes that a number of fundamental principles should be
applied to the development and provision of wheelchairs and wheelchair
programming. 
First and foremost, like the provision of prostheses, providing
wheelchairs is not just about the chair itself. Rather, it is about
increasing the quality of a survivor's life through increased mobility,
independence and integration into society. When the wheelchair itself is
the focus, there is a great temptation for an organization to take a
""one size fits all"" approach and mass produce, or collect donated chairs
and conduct mass deliveries. Not only are these wheelchairs generally
ill-suited to the rough urban and rural environments of low-income
countries, but they do not provide long-term solutions, and have in some
cases, caused the collapse of local wheelchair manufacturing
enterprises. 
Second, while numerous non-governmental organizations endeavor to
provide wheelchairs, few attempt to establish indigenous wheelchair
production. While shipments of appropriate wheelchairs may provide a
short-term benefit to a small group of people, supporting local and
small-scale production of good quality, repairable, and affordable
chairs in country is better development practice. Similarly, regional
production coupled with local assembly and repair offers opportunities
for sustainability. 
Third, the usefulness of a wheelchair is directly related to the
training and expertise of the technician fitting the chair, proper
assessment and prescription, and basic training in safe and effective
use. 
Finally, the provision or use of a wheelchair is only a beginning step
to enabling a wheelchair user to improve their quality of life and play
a role within their community. Greater investments still need to be made
in local disabled people's organizations and self-help groups, increased
opportunities need to be provided to attend school and be active in the
workplace, and increased advocacy on a local and national level needs to
take place. 
4. Funding Available, Number of Awards and Types of Assistance:  This is
an open Annual Program Statement (APS) under which USAID solicits
proposals from organizations that are interested in addressing the
diverse needs of people requiring wheelchairs in the developing world.
Proposals will be reviewed by USAID using the process described below. 
Funding Available and Number of Awards: The actual number of awards
under this APS is subject to the availability of funds and the viability
of proposals received. Accordingly, USAID reserves the right to make
multiple grants or no awards at all through this APS. LWVF is a
worldwide program and may fund programs in any of the USAID regions:
Africa, Latin American and Caribbean, Europe and Eurasia, and Asia and
Near East. Preference will be given to applications for programs in
countries that already receive USAID funding (disaster or development
assistance). No award will be made without the concurrence of the USAID
mission or Embassy in the country under consideration. Subject to the
foregoing, USAID is planning for a program of up to $5 million over five
years, beginning in FY 2003. The Bureau is open to working with both
large and small organizations, organizations with both experience and no
experience in working with the U.S. government or USAID. Grant requests
should generally range from $50,000 to $500,000 per year. Proposals may
be for as little as one year and up to a maximum of five years.
Proposals for less than that amount may be acceptable, but must
demonstrate a high priority, as well as targeted, rapid, and lasting
impact. 
USAID shall not be liable for any costs incurred by applicants in
preparation and submission of concept papers or applications. 
USAID reserves the right to award cooperative agreements instead of
grants if deemed more desirable or appropriate. If USAID elects to award
a cooperative agreement instead of a grant, a cooperative agreement will
permit the ""substantial involvement"" of USAID in program activities.
Specifically, USAID substantial involvement will involve the approval
of: (a) annual work plans; (b) not more than five (5) key personnel
appointments; (c) program monitoring and evaluation plans; (d)
subcontracts and subagreements and subcontractors/subrecipients; and (e)
agreement in the selection of advisory committee members, if applicable.
Financial reporting will depend on the payment provisions of the
cooperative agreement(s), which cannot be determined until the
successful applicant(s) is(are) selected. In no case, however, will
financial reporting be required more frequently than progress reporting.
Such reporting will be quarterly, with reports due 30 days after the end
of each calendar quarter. Final progress reports will be due 90 days
after the expiration of the cooperative agreement(s). 
5. Application Process:  Applicants shall submit an original and two (2)
copies of the Technical Application and an original and one (1) copy of
the Cost Application. An electronic copy of both the technical and cost
applications must also be provided on a 3.5"" disk (MS Word or Excel
format). 
Applications must be submitted in English. Unnecessarily elaborate
brochures or other presentations beyond those sufficient to present a
complete and effective application are not desired and may be construed
as an indication of the prospective recipient's lack of cost
consciousness. Elaborate artwork, expensive paper and bindings and
expensive visual and other presentation aids are neither necessary nor
desired. 
Applicants must be submitted in accordance with the requirements set
forth below: 
Application Instructions 
a. All applications must be in size 12 font, New Times Roman. 
b. The length of the application should not exceed the following page
limits:

The attachments may also include relevant information about implementing
partners, including documentation of their intent to participate. 
Applications must be submitted to the following address: 
Mr. Lloyd Feinberg 
DCHA/DG/SPANS Rm. 3.07-10 
U.S. Agency for International Development 
1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW 
Washington DC 20523-3100 
If applications are hand delivered to USAID/Washington, couriers must
report to the building guard at the 14th Street entrance. The guard
cannot accept applications, but will call DCHA/DG for someone to come to
the reception desk and accept the application. The courier must wait
until the DCHA/DG representative arrives to accept the application. It
is recommend that the applicant contact USAID in advance of any courier
delivery to ensure that someone will be available to receive the
application, which cannot be left unattended at the guard station.
Electronic transmittal of the final application (including budget and
budget narrative) shall also constitute an official submission, but
USAID does not accept any responsibility for delays in transmission or
receipt. 
From among the applications, USAID will select those that it intends to
fund and will proceed to negotiate an award with each successful
applicant subject to the availability of funding. The final decision for
funding will be based on both a technical review and the availability of
USAID funding. USAID reserves the right to fund one or more or none of
the applications that may be submitted. All applications will be
evaluated according to the criteria below. 
Note that all applicants may be subject to a pre-award financial review.
Further, organizations that believe they may not meet USAID's financial
accountability requirements are encouraged to submit their proposal in
partnership with eligible U.S. or international, or regional
organizations that are experienced with these requirements in order to
promote sustainability of programs after USAID support ends. 
6. Review and Evaluation Process:  USAID will review all applications
submitted prior to COB August 12, 2004 in an initial round of reviews.
Applications submitted after August 12, 2004 will be reviewed
approximately on a quarterly basis until January 31, 2005. 
Partner Eligibility Criteria 
Potential partners include: private voluntary organizations,
foundations, colleges and universities, civic groups, faith-based
institutions, international organizations, private businesses and
associations, regional organizations, philanthropic organizations, and
advocacy groups. Potential for-profit applicants should note that USAID
policy prohibits the payment of fee/profit to the prime recipient under
grants and cooperative agreements. Forgone profit does not qualify as
cost sharing or leveraging. Note that the preceding list of potential
partners is for illustrative purposes only, as our criteria for
eligibility are broad. USAID welcomes other, new types of partners. 
USAID encourages proposals that embrace our Global Development Alliance
- a USAID initiative that seeks to leverage USG funds by matches from
private sources, preferably not less than 1:1. To be counted as a GDA
initiative, there must be a clear expectation that USAID resources will
be at least matched one-to-one by all other resources combined, both
public (e.g., official, bilateral, multilateral, or governmental) and
private (e.g., from companies, foundations, universities, NGOs, or
individuals), so long as private resources equal at least 25% of USAID's
contribution. 
Applications are not required to include cost-sharing provisions.
Applications that include additional in-kind and/or cash contributions
from non-U.S. government sources will, however, be give special
consideration since cost sharing demonstrates a strong commitment to the
proposed program. Cost sharing includes contributions, both cash and
in-kind, which are necessary and reasonable to achieve program
objectives and which are verifiable from the recipient's records. Cost
sharing contributions may include volunteer services provided by
professional and technical personnel, and un-recovered indirect costs.
However, cost sharing does not include forgone profit. Applicants that
do not include such contributions are encouraged to provide a rationale
for not doing so. 
Program Eligibility Criteria 
To be considered for funding under this APS, proposed programs must meet
all of the following requirements: 
- Proposals must have clearly-defined objectives that lead to
empirically verifiable results through an effective methodology 
- Proposals should reflect some combination of the following factors;
expertise and/or experience, innovative and new ideas, effective use of
technologies 
- Proposals must address one or more of the priorities and concerns
listed earlier in this APS 
- Proposals must offer promise of significant development impact, as
measured, for example, by the number of direct and indirect
beneficiaries of the program, and/or by the potential for replication or
scaling-up over time 
- Proposals must be feasible from a technical, economic, financial, and
social perspective 
Selection Criteria for Applications 
The criteria listed below will serve as the basis upon which all
applications will be evaluated. Technical aspects of the applications,
evaluated according to the criteria below, will constitute 40 points of
the total evaluation, and must demonstrate the likelihood that the
proposed program will be successful in achieving its objectives.
Applicants' organizational experience, past performance, and quality of
key staff will constitute 40 points of the evaluation; this will include
an assessment of the applicants' ability to achieve expected results
within a reasonable time frame. The remaining 20 points will be based on
fairness and reasonableness of costs. 
1. Technical Approach - 40 points 
Applications shall have a clear definition of the problem which the
grant activity intends to address, supported by reliable data and
consultations with the local communities and appropriate host country
organizations to the extent necessary; clearly define the nature of
intervention/s that will be provided and strongly establish the
relationship of these interventions with defined problem; interventions
must focus on problem solving rather than simply problem identification.
The application shall have a strong likelihood of appropriate
sustainability with a sensible scheme for addressing this concern. USAID
will look for evidence of broad-based local support, including evidence
of significant local contributions from participant ""stakeholders"" as
well as other entities that are sympathetic with the proposed activity.
Further, applications shall have an evaluation and reporting plan
incorporating such critical elements as: impact indicators,
gender-disaggregated data collection, monitoring, program audit,
preparation of financial status reports, and progress reports. USAID
will give priority to applications that demonstrate innovative
approaches in reaching and engaging the participation of target
beneficiaries, host country agencies, and other stakeholders as well as
incorporate, as appropriate, a well defined system for selecting
developing and strengthening the organizational and management
capabilities of local communities and counterpart agencies. 
2. Institutional Qualifications/Past Performance/Personnel - 40 points 
Applications will be evaluated on both past performance as well as
program intentions. Applications should demonstrate a thoroughness and
understanding of management principles, technically sound planning and
operations management, and the capabilities necessary to successfully
manage the program; including USAID regulations. If a sub-grant
mechanism is proposed, the applicant must demonstrable the ability to
manage and implement such a program. Proposed key staff should have
successful, verifiable, and recent experience and there should be
demonstrable experience in developing and sustaining effective,
collaborative work with grant stakeholders, other organizations, and
host country representatives. Previous experience in the development and
implementation of strategies that contribute to the functional
reintegration of people with disabilities, especially those requiring
wheelchairs, will be appropriately recognized 
3. Cost Considerations - 20 points 
Applications will be evaluated on both the fairness and reasonableness
of all proposed costs, cost sharing and the extent to which local buy-in
(not necessarily financial) is demonstrated. 
USAID reserves the right to make multiple grants or no awards at all
through this APS. Programs selected for funding will be based on the
score of the technical evaluations, evidence or organizational
responsibility, USAID priorities, ability and willingness of concerned
USAID Missions to award and manage the activity, and the availability of
funds. If the results of USAID's assessment are not positive, written
notification will be provided to the applicant. If the results are
positive, the selected organization will be notified. Additional
information and program revisions may be required.

ABOUT:  UNDP Armenia under the project 00064044 Strengthening National
Capacities for Disaster Preparedness and Risk Reduction- 2nd phase aims
at strengthening the legal and institutional framework for disaster risk
management (DRM) in Armenia, including the development of a comprehensive
National Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Strategy. As a significant input
for this work, the enhancement of the disaster risk identification,
assessment and monitoring system in Armenia is also envisioned. This will
be done through supporting and facilitating a multi-stakeholder process
of national risk assessment, with the ultimate goal of setting up a
mechanism for regularly updating the country disaster risk profile,
establishing the institutional framework for risk assessment, and
utilizing analyzed data in national DRR policies and strategies. 
In order to support the national risk assessment processes, the
establishment of a National Disaster Observatory (NDO) for Armenia is
being considered. 
An NDO is a sustainable (National) institution for the systematic
collection, analysis and interpretation of data of disasters of different
levels. It consists of 3 key components  an official institution to host
the NDO, a nation-wide network of disaster registration, and a
computational infrastructure (software, database, applications, etc.).
Main applications of NDO include:
- Inputs to the National DRR Strategy: for better definition of goals,
priorities and structure of risk reduction measures;
- Calibration and validation of risk assessments: Confronting estimated
vs. realized losses;
- Assessment of vulnerability and recovery capacity: Physical, social,
financial, political vulnerabilities; and
- Monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of Disaster Risk
Reduction strategies and measures: for monitoring the Hyogo Framework for
Action implementation.
The Global Risk Identification Programme  (GRIP) will provide technical
support and advice on methodologies and the implementation of NDO
establishment project.

OPENING DATE:  03 July 2013
APPLICATION DEADLINE:  16 July 2013
ABOUT COMPANY:  World Vision started work in Armenia in 1988 following
the devastating earthquake that killed more than 25,000 people. From this
initial relief start, today World Vision Armenia has strong development,
relief, and advocacy programming. With 13 Area Development Programs (ADP)
in six marzes (provinces) the program covers the country, SEF
International (World Visions MFI) has fifteen branches, mainly in ADP
areas. Overall, the program is complex with many connections to partner
and donor organizations. Advocacy is increasingly an important part of
our program as we move from service delivery to an empowerment model, and
representation at the highest Government and International Community
levels critical for the future of the program.
WV Armenia is currently a Branch office of WVI, in South Caucasus
Sub-region within MEER Region. An Advisory Council has been established,
that provides high level advice to the Program Director. The Program
Director is also a board member of SEF Board of Directors.
ABOUT:  Armenia is situated in Eastern Europe and occupies a territory of
29.74 thousand square kilometres. The country neighbors with Georgia in
the North, Azerbaijan in the East, Iran in the South, Azerbaijan in the
South-West; and Turkey in the West.
Armenia gained its independence in 1991 through a referendum. Currently
the Republic of Armenia is a sovereign, democratic, social, rule of law
state. The past years of transition from a centralized economy to an open
market economy have led to impoverishment, increased unemployment and a
crippled social security network in Armenia. In 2012, almost 36% of the
population lives below the poverty line on approximately USD 97 per
month. Since 1991, Armenia has been receiving significant relief aid and
development assistance from international donors, mostly to lessen the
negative side effects of transition, the effect of the conflict with
Azerbaijan and to develop the national financial and legal
infrastructure. Many of the development projects in Armenia concern the
immediate physical needs in local infrastructure rehabilitation and are
usually short-term. Though the communities benefit from the improvements,
they remain fragmented, and incapable to meet the on-going social and
economic challenges. In addition, the main social and economic capital
and activity is centralized in Yerevan, and less in 2-3 other major
cities, while the rural settings are out of focus of local and external
investments allowing for growing migration from villages to cities and
abroad.
The Armenian Apostolic (Orthodox) Church is the largest church in
Armenia, but lacks sufficient priests to serve communities across the
country. The other biggest Christian denominations present in the country
are Catholic and Evangelical Churches. Although the followers of the
latter constitute are 3% of the country population. The biggest ethnic
minority are Yezidi (monotheist with elements of nature worship)
constituting 1.3%.  www.armstat.am.

ABOUT COMPANY:  The USAID-funded Enterprise Development and Market
Competitiveness (EDMC) Project is a five-year intervention designed to
raise incomes and employment in Armenia by promoting growth in four
selected value chains (VCs) with export potential: Information
Technologies, Biopharmaceuticals, Food Processing and Tourism. Value
chains represent dynamic building blocks of the economy, subject to
evolution and change. Focusing on the role of small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs), the Project is expected to facilitate the development
of competitive enterprises and value chains by stimulating innovation,
enhancing workforce skills, accelerating new enterprise formation,
improving access to finance, and addressing shortcomings in the business
environment. The Project will employ technical assistance, training, and
grants to assist targeted value chains in going global, to reach into
new and expand within existing markets. The Project is designed to be a
catalyst, mobilizing additional resources from other sources to
accelerate growth in these value chains. Success of EDMC is measured by
three headline indicators: increased sales, export and employment in
EDMCs four target value chains. EDMC will also support cross-cutting
efforts such as gender, alliance building, advocacy, institutional
development and clean energy production in the four targeted value
chains.

ABOUT COMPANY:  With funding from the European Union, the European
Neighbourhood Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development (ENPARD)
supports the Government of Armenia in ensuring an efficient and
sustainable agriculture that contributes to better living conditions in
rural areas. Within ENPARD Armenia a technical assistance component
focuses on producer group and value chain development. This component is
implemented by UNIDO and UNDP with funding from the EU (2.4 million euro)
and co-funding from the Austrian Government (1 million euro). In
particular the project aims to strengthen producer groups, effectively
engage producer groups in value addition activities, strengthen value
chains that provide improved access to affordable, better quality food,
contribute to the development of rural areas and improve access to local
and international markets, and ensure the introduction of
environmentally-friendly farming and food processing practices. Direct
beneficiaries of the project include agricultural producers, members of
producer groups and their employees, their families and SMEs along the
value chains as well as Armenian consumers. The project also will focus
on women, youth, and other vulnerable groups. 
The technical assistance component of ENPARD, implemented by UNIDO and
UNDP, has three primary outputs:
- Output 1: Strengthened and newly established primary producer groups.
Within the targeted value chains and marzes, the project will develop
effective, sustainable new producer groups as well as assist and
strengthen existing ones in the various stages of their development;
- Output 2: Producer groups effectively engaged in value addition. The
project will support the building of physical infrastructure as well as
human capacity and skills that enable producers to add value to primary
agricultural production;
- Output 3: Strengthened value chains that provide improved access to
affordable, better quality food. The project will identify and develop
key intervention points at any level within the selected value chains
that will benefit not only stakeholders of those value chains but also
Armenian consumers locally and nationally.
This consultancy is situated within Output 3, described above, with the
objective of producing a comprehensive analysis of the selected value
chains. The selected value chains include:
- High value field crops, with a focus on buckwheat and lentils;
- Non-traditional and high-value vegetables;
- Berries and fruits;
- Dairy.
