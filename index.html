              job is a crucial to have happy life. Hence, many people are preparing hard for it. However, it is more
              stressful and challenging for disabled people to catch satisfaction and desire when it comes to finding
              jobs. Our enthusiasm and empathy led us to create this AI-based product where disabled employees log into
              this website and get an organized list of jobs that are suitable or optimal for their physical or mental
              condition. On the other hand, employers could provide more inclusive and discrimination-free job positing
              via suggestion from AI job posting evaluator. Our product becomes solid and reliable bridge between
              disabled employee and employers. It reduces burdens on disabled employees for finding jobs while benefits
              employers to get government's supports for accommodation and employment cost.</li>
