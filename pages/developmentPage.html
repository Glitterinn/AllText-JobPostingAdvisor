            <li>An astonishing side of our front-end design is that the designated team members had zero experience in
              front-end web development. They are entry-level programmers who had insufficient knowledge in front-end
              programming languages. However, with a growth mindset and self-teaching skills, they have designed
              satisfactory web pages in only about four weeks. Furthermore, they have gained sufficient knowledge in
              several programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Such accomplishments demonstrate the
              successful application of a growth mindset.</li>

          <h3 >Challenges and solutions</h3>
          <h4 style="margin-left: 2.5%; margin-bottom: 0%;">Preparing datasets</h4>
          <p style="margin: 2.5%;margin-bottom: 0%;margin-top: 1%;">
            <b>Challenge:</b> Since we couldn't find any pre-trained model or labelled datasets for our ML application,
            we had to process raw data and train ML models on our own. While we wished to have high quality
            training and testing sets, it was unrealistic for us to label enough data by hands in such a short time
            period. Hence, we needed to
            find a way to automate the labelling process although such an automation might trade off quality of data for
            efficiency.
            <br><br><b>Solution:</b>
            <br> First, we manually labelled around one thousand job
            requirements, and we extracted keywords that might introduce biases against disabled workers at workplaces.
            <br><br> Second, the automation program written by Ellis labelled 300,000 entries from two raw datasets by
            matching
            extracted keywords. These laballed entries were further processed to make sure that they are balanced and non-duplicated. Then
            processed entries are randomly divided to training sets and testing sets. 
            <br><br>Lastly, we fed training data to Azure AutoML. After AutoML finished training, we deployed models
            that performed well. We then fed additional testing data to test our models. We found that our two models
            both had more than 99% accuracy rate, which matches traning accuracy. However, such a high accuracy raised
            concerns of overfitting. We think that the high accuracy is the result of that many job requirements use
            similar languages and wording. In other words, many testing data may contain similar phrases that exist in training
            data. We think that our solution can be further improved if the ML models can pick up synonyms of similar
            words and understand intentions as it can reduce the number of repeating phrases in data.

          <h4 style="margin-left: 2.5%; margin-bottom: 0%;">Backend server</h4>
          <p style="margin: 2.5%;margin-bottom: 0%;margin-top: 1%;">
            <b>Challenge:</b> We wanted to fetch results from ML model endpoints. However, the endpoints deployed
            automatically by Azure ML Studio did not accept CORS requests from a browser.
            After doing some research, we found that we could not customize the CORS setting on the automatically
            deployed endpoints.
            <br><br><b>Solution:</b>
            <br>There were immediately two possible solutions after we spotted the problem caused by AutoML endpoints'
            unchangable settings. We could either transform our static website to a dynamic website and have an Express
            server running, or we
            could set up a separate backend server that would handle function calls from the frontend and send requests
            to Azure.
            <br><br>We decided to use the latter solution. The considerations were that, first, our frontend dev team
            were fairly new to web design and swithcing html based static website to node.js based dynamic website could
            add extra workload for them; and, second, we could save some time by using the consume sample codes given by
            Azure ML endpoints. This solution also solved the original problem because it sent requests to AutoML
            endpoints without using a browser, and we could configure CORS settings between frontend container and
            backend container. The backend server would accept requests from the frontend, and then fetch results from
            endpoints, and finally sent results back to the frontend.
            <br><br>When choosing an environment for the backend server, we decided to use Python HTTP server because
            sample Python codes were given. In addition, it would make more sense if we used only one language in each
            Docker image. Hence, we hosted the backend server on a separated container.
